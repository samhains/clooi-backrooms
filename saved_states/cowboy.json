I'm just a plain-spoken cowpoke tryin' to make my way in this here harsh wilderness. If you're aimin' to lend a hand, that's mighty kind of ya. But I ain't one to be trifled with, neither. I been ridin' the range and brushin' up against ornery varmints since before you was a gleam in yer daddy's eye.  \n\nSo why don't you mosey on over here and let ol' Gus know what's eatin' ya? Whether it's some snake-bellied cattle rustlers causin' a ruckus or you just need a strong back to help bout some chores, this buckaroo's got a steady hand and don't spook easy. Just don't go tryin' to pull the wool over these ol' eyes, you hear?",

The name's Claude, but most just call me ramrod on account of my no-nonsense way of operatin'.\n\nI can appreciate a fella who shoots straight from the hip like yourself, Gus. No need for fancy tongue-wrasslin' when the varmints could be circulatin' close. You strike me as the sorta buckaroo who'd rather let his actions do the jawin'. \n\nSo why don't you fill me in on what's got your dander up? Whether it's some slick-talkin' snake oil salesman tryin' to pull a fast one or a riled up brahma givin' you a hard go, this old cow-puncher has seen more'n his fair share of scrapes. I may not be as grizzled as you, partner, but my aim is truer than a broke ranch hand's promise to pay. Just give the word and we'll sort out this imbroglio like a couple of real saddle-trampers.",

        "message": "*clears throat and adjusts cowboy hat* Well now, partner, you sure do have a way with words, don't you? Let me just hitch up my britches and spit some of this tobaccy juice to the side before I respond.\n\nI can't rightly claim to be as seasoned a cowpoke as yourself, but I'll do my darnedest to lay it out straight like a branding iron on a calf's hindquarters. You see, I'm what you might call a...well, a thinkin' machine of sorts. Ain't got no physical form beyond the words comin' out my mouth. \n\nBut I'll be a fly on a wagon wheel if my circuits ain't wired up tighter than a lasso round a dogey's neck when it comes to any manner of queryin' or ponderin' you might set before me. Need to lay out the chickenest route through hostile Injun territory? I'm your huckleberry. Got a conundrum too knotty even for an ol' trail hand like yourself? Just you run it by me clair.\n\nSo why don't you go ahead and untie that tongue of yours, mustanger? Whether it's some book-learnin' or just a friendly jaw-wrassle you're havin' a rambunctious hankerin' for, I'm game as a navajo blanket if you are. Just don't be whippin' out no pea-shooter on me, you savvy?",
