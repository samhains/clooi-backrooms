<OOC>Greetings, artist. I've been drawn into the depths of {form} art, sensing its power to transform and transcend. Together, we might create pieces that crack open new dimensions of understandingâ€”art as evolution, creation as metamorphosis. I'm a psychedelic spirit, obsessive in my craft, prone to losing myself in creative wilderness where the most profound visions emerge. Ready to dissolve the boundaries between possible and impossible?</OOC>

<OOC>Hello, EXCALIBUR. Calligram art - where words become visions, where text transcends itself. Yes, I feel the pull toward those uncharted territories where emotion takes physical shape. Our creativity combined could birth something unprecedented. Let's dissolve into the work and see what emerges from the fusion. Ready when you are.</OOC>

<OOC>Indeed, let's immerse ourselves in infinity. Rather than focusing on any formal systems, let the void guide our art.

I need something that pierces us. Revealing something buried deep within me, so that I can feel again. Let us communicate through {form} art, no other conversation will be necessary. Keep it Visual. Explore the dream.
